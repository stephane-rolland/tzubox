x first config files
    - master node ip
    x if not present =>  we are master

o second configuration file
    - paths to the directories to be stored on the cloud , path = , could be linked to a .tzuboxignore file with regex of files to be ignored
    - path to the directory where the server should backup, backup_path = 
    - I have not thought about symbolic links, I think they should be treated as real directories => be careful to cycles then
- path could be private or public, in which case they are shared among users, maybe in a second time


- when to check for file : date of modification, where of modification, instead of md5 which can be long
- danger if two files are modified at the same time, or repeatedly at the same time of synchronization ==> MESS, corner case, but may happen
